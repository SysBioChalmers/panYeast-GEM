This folder should contain Matlab scripts for the following:
- 1. UpdatePanGPR: mapping isoenzymes and orthologs in Pan Genome for existing gprRules
- 2. addPanModelRxn: Add changes from the Pan genome new anootation for new reactions and new metabolites and new genes related + manual curation on those changes
- 3. changeGenesonlyinGEMtoPanID: This function is to convert genes that only exist in GEM to corresponding ortholog PanIDs(PanIDs only store one copy of the duplication genes)
- 4. SpecificModel: Construct strain-specific (draft) GEMs based on the Panmodel constructed by above steps
