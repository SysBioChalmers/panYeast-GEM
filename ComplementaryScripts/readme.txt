This folder should contain Matlab scripts for the following:
- 1. UpdatePanGPRï¼šAdd changes from the Pangenome new anootation for new genes + manual curation on those changes
- 2. addPanModelRxn: Add changes from the Pan genome new anootation for new reactions and new metabolites and new genes related + manual curation on those changes
- 3. changeGenesonlyinGEMtoPanID: This function is to convet genes that only exist in GEM to corresponding PanIDs(PanIDs only store one copy of the duplication genes)
- 4. SpecificModel: Construct strain-specific (draft) GEMs based on the Panmodel constructed by above steps
- Potential gap-filling to result in functional models
- Scripts that evaluate the models and generates figures, tables etc. for publication
